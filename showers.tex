\label{sec:showers}


In this chapter, a brief introduction to Extensive Air Showers (EAS)
will be given. Althought the physics behind EAS is very rich,
in this text we will give more focus on the selected topics
which are intrinsically related to the main topic of this thesis.
More detailed and extended materials about EAS can be found
in Refs.~\cite{GaisserBook,GriederBook}.

\section{Extensive air shower phenomenology}
\label{sec:showers:phen}

An EAS start with the collision of the primary cosmic ray particle
with an atmospheric nucleus. After this first interaction, the secondary
particle produced also interact with the atmosphere producing more
particles and so on. This succession of interactions with particle production
create the cascade of particles that forms the air shower.
For the sake of clarity, the description of the cascade is tradionally
done by spliting it into different components: the \emph{electromagnetic},
the \emph{hadronic} and, eventually, the \emph{muonic component}. It is also traditional
to describe the EAS development in terms of its longitudinal and lateral profiles.
The former refers to the shower development along the direction of its axis
while the latter refers to the distribution of particles
along a perpendicular direction to shower axis.


The first interaction can produce tens or hundreds of
secondary particles, which are nearly all hadrons
with only an insignificant contribution of photons and leptons.
Among the produced hadrons, the dominant contribution is by far from pions ($>60\%$),
followed by kaons and nucleons at similar proportions ($\sim 10\%$). Other
types of mesons and baryons together count tipically for less than 5\% of
the particles~\cite{Calcagni:2017tws}.
Besides that, a very small fraction of nuclei can be produced
by the fragmentation of the target nucleus or the primary.
After the first interaction, the following air shower development is mostly driven
by the subsequent processes involving the pions. The three types of pions ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$ and $\pi^0$)
are produced at similar proportions, which means that about 2/3 of them are charged and
1/3 is neutral. The charged ones will be responsible to create more
hadrons and eventually muon and the neutral ones to create photons and
to fed the electromagnetic component of the shower.
First we will focus on the latter case.

%%================================%%
\subsection[Electromagnetic component and the \xmax]{\boldmath Electromagnetic component and the \xmax}
\label{sec:showers:phen:em}


Neutral pions can decay via the electromagnetic interaction into two photons ($\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma$)
with a very short decay length ($c\tau_0=25$ nm). Since in the atmosphere this decay length
is much shorter than the interaction one, nearly all the neutral pions end up decaying into
photons. The high energy photons produced interact electromagnetically, being the dominant
process the pair production ($\gamma\rightarrow e^++e^-$). The electrons and positrons
produced, in turn, also interact electromagnetically, mainly through bremstralung, which
produces more photons. The succession of these electromagnetic interactions
will create a self-sustainable cascade of photons, electrons and positrons
which forms the electromagnetic component of the extensive air shower.
Since more neutral pions are produced in hadronic interactions of secondary
particles with atmospheric nuclei (again in the 1/3 proportion wrt the charged pions),
the same chain of electromagnetic interactions will take place again
and new lower energy electromagnetic cascades are produced.
This means that the energy carried by the hadronic particles
is partially, but constinuously, trasfered to the electromagnetic particles.
After a few generations of hadronic interactions ($\sim 6$), about 90\% of
the primary energy is carried by the electromagnetic component.


The lenght scale of the bremstralung interaction, responsible to produce photons out of
electrons, is given by the radiation lenght, $X_0$, that is the average distance needed
to electrons to lose all but $1/e$ of its energy. In the atmosphere $X_0\approx 37\text{g/cm}^2$.
On the other hand, the lenght scale of pair production is of the same order
of $X_0$, only slightly larger ($\approx 1.3 X_0$). Because of the short lenght scale
given by $X_0$, the electromagnetic shower develops very rapidly, which
implies a fast increase of the number of particles and a fast decrease of their
average energy. As lower the particle energies, more relevant the energy losses
due to ionization become. The critical energy in which the ionization losses
becomes equivalent to the bremstralung ones is $E_c = 85 \MeV$ in the
atmosphere. After the average energy of electrons becomes close to $E_c$,
the number of particles starts to decrease, which creates the peaked shape
of the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic component.

In~\cref{} we show the average longitudinal profile of the number
of electrons ($N_e$) in air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei.
It is also shown for comparison the longitudinal profile of the
deposited energy (\dEdX) in the atmosphere by all the charged particles.
Because the number of particles in the shower is totally dominated
by the electromagnetic component, one can see that the shape of the
$N_e$ and \dEdX profiles are basically the same.
The depth correspondent to the maximum of both profiles is called
the shower maximum and it is symbolized by \xmax. In air shower
experiments, the \dEdX profile can be accessed by telescopes which
measure the fluorescence light emitted by the interaction of the air shower
with the atmosphere. The \xmax of the shower can then be easily determined
from the \dEdX profile.

The dependences of \xmax with the primary energy and with the type
of the primary particle can be expressed by the relation
\begin{equation}
  \langle\xmax\rangle = \lambda_\text{I}(A)+D_{10}\;\log_{10}\frac{E_0}{A},
  \label{eq:shower:xmax}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\text{I}$ is the mean free path of the first interaction,
$E_0$ is the energy of the primary particle and $A$ is its nuclear mass.
The quantity $D_{10} = \frac{ \text{d} \xmaxmean }{ \text{d} \log_{10}E_0 }$
is called \emph{elongation rate} and it does not depend on $E_0$ and $A$.
Although the~\cref{eq:shower:xmax} can be derived by simplistic analtytic models~\cite{Matthews:2005sd},
it can also be certified by using full Monte Carlo simulations.

In~\cref{} we show the \xmaxmean as a function of the primary energy
for a set of simulatied air showers. The logaritmic energy dependece is clear,
as well as the separation between proton and iron initiated showers.
This dependence of \xmaxmean with the primary mass comes from both terms
on the right side of~\cref{eq:shower:xmax}, since $\lambda_\text{I}$
decreases with increasing $A$. The difference between \xmaxmean for
proton and iron initiated showers is $\sim 100 \text{g/cm}^2$, as can
be seen in~\cref{}. It is also clear from~\cref{} that the elongation rate
$D_{10}$ is nearly constant with energy and does not depend on the primary type.
For using \xmax measurements to infer the primary composition of
cosmic rays, both the differences on \xmax for different primaries and
the constancy of $D_{10}$ are important features. More about measurements
of \xmax will be given in~\cref{}. 


%%================================%%
\subsection{Hadronic component and muon production}
\label{sec:showers:phen:had}

Unlike the neutral pions, the charged ones can only decay weakly,
with a much longer decay length ($c\tau_0=7.8$ m)
than the electromagnetic $\pi^0$ decay.  
At high energies, however, their interaction length
is much smaller than the decay one. This means that most
of the charged pions actually interact with atmospheric nuclei
producing more particles at similar proportions as the ones produced
in the first interaction. While the neutral pions produced
fed the electromagnetic shower, as explained above, the charged ones
can keep interacting and producing more hadrons. The hadrons
produced by this chain of hadronic interactions compose the
hadronic component of the shower.

As lower the energy of the charged pions, larger the probability
that it decays instead of interacting again. The dominant decay channel
for charged pions is into muons and neutrinos ($\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$)
and the critical energy in which the probability of decaying is
equivalent to interacting is 85 \GeV. These decays are responsible
to produce the great majority of the muons of an air shower.
The tipical number of interactions of charged pions before
decaying into muons is 4--8. 


Apart from pion decays, a considerably fraction of the muons reaching
the ground is produced by the decay of charged kaons. In~\cite{} the muon
production in air showers was studyied in details and it was found
by using simulations that $\sim 90\%$ of the muons come from the decay
of charged pions and $\sim 10\%$ of charged kaons. While these particles
are called \emph{mother}, the particles which interacted hadronically
with an atmospheric nucleus to produce them is are called \emph{grandmother}.
Concerning then the properties of the grandmother particles,
it was found that more than 70\% of them are pions, $\approx 20\%$ are nucleons
and $\approx 6\%$ are kaons. In~\cref{} the energy distributions of the
grandmother particles are shown and we can see the contribution from these
different types of particles. The dominance of pions as gradmother is clear,
as well as the fact that most of the interactions of the grandmother particles
occur at energies of order of $\sim 100 \GeV$.


Although the interaction of the grandmother particle is very important,
it has to be noted that the whole chain of hadronic interactions, which are
mostly pion-air interactions, influence the muon production. This means
that any shower observable related to the muonic component is sensitive to the
properties of hadronic interactions which occur along the shower. The particle
production in these hadronic interactions is particularly important and,
in the context of this thesis, it is worthwhile to point out the effect of
(anti)baryon production. Most of the (anti)baryons produced are
nucleons (\proton, \antiproton, \neutron and \antineutron) and they
are all produced in similar proportions. Since these particles
can only interact again, their energy is surely use to fed the
hadronic component, which means that this energy is partially converted
in muons production. Because of that, the increase of (anti)baryon
production in hadron-air interactions has been considered a very important
mechanism to increase the final number of muons in the shower~\cite{\EposPaper,Drescher:2007hc}.
\note{spectrum of muons}


In~\cref{} we show the average longitudinal profile of
the number of muons, as well as the muon production,
for proton and iron initiated showers. The number of muons (\nmu) observed
at a given atmospheric depth is a tipical quantity of the shower.
From simplistic analytic models and full Monte Carlo simulations,
we can see that \nmu relates to the primary energy and mass as
\begin{equation}
  \nmumean \approx A^{1-\beta} E_0^\beta,
  \label{eq:shower:nmu}
\end{equation}
where $\beta\approx 0.9$. The energy and primary mass dependence
of \nmumean can be seen in~\cref{}, where we show the \nmumean
as a function of $\log_{10}E_0$, also for proton and iron
initiated showers.
Results of recent measurements of \nmu, as well as other
observables related to the muonic component will be presented
in~\cref{sec:shower:observables}.

\section{Measurements of extensive air shower observables}
\label{sec:shower:observables}

In this section, a compilation of recent measurements of EAS observables
will be presented. We start in~\cref{sec:shower:observables:xmax}
by the \xmax measurements which are the most reliable
observable to be used to infer composition of cosmic rays. 
In~\cref{sec:shower:observables:nmu,sec:shower:observables:xmumax}
we focus on two muonic observables, the \nmu and \xmumax,
which currently cannot be direct used for composition studies
due to the inconsistency between the measurements and the predictions
from Monte Carlo simulations. In~\cref{sec:shower:observables:further}
we briefly mention further observables which have been measured recently.


%%================================%%
\subsection{Shower maximum and cosmic ray composition}
\label{sec:shower:observables:xmax}

The \xmax (see~\cref{sec:showers:phen:em}) can be measured directly
by fluorescence telescopes, which can measure the energy deposited
by the air shower along the atmosphere. This technique was first sucesfully applied
by Fly's Eyes experiment~\cite{\FlysEyesPaper},
posteriorly followed by HiRes~\cite{\HiResPaper} and recently it
has been used by Telescope Array~\cite{\TAXmaxPaper} and
Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerPaper,\AugerXmaxPRDPaper}.
Another technique commonly used in the past to measure tha \xmax
are the non-imaging Cherenkov detectors. From the lateral profile
of the Cherenkov light measured in surface detectors, it is possible
to infer the longitudinal position of the shower maximum~\cite{}.
This method was used by Tunka~\cite{\TunkaPaper,\TunkaXmaxPaper},
Yakutsk~\cite{\YakutskPaper,\YakutskXmaxPaper} and CASA-BLANCA~\cite{\CasaBlancaXmaxPaper}.
In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:all}
we show a compilation of \xmaxmean measurements from \E{15.0}
up to the highest energies and
in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:uhe} we show the most up to date
\xmaxmean results of Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerXmaxICRC2017Paper} and Telescope Array~\cite{}.
Besides the \xmaxmean, Pierre Auger Observatory can also measure
the standard deviation of the \xmax distribution, $\sigma[\xmax]$.
We also show the $\sigma[\xmax]$ results in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:uhe}.

The colored lines in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:all}
show the \xmaxmean predictions from
Monte Carlo simulations. It is traditional to show lines for
the lightest primary expected, protons, and for the heaviest, iron nuclei.
By comparing the \xmax measurements with the Monte Carlo predictions,
one can obtain information about the average composition of the primary cosmic rays.
Besides the comparison of the \xmax moments (\xmaxmean and $\sigma[\xmax]$),
the full \xmax distributions can be compared and the fractions of different
groups of primaries can be fitted. This procedure has only been applied by Pierre Auger
Observatory~\cite{Aab:2014aea}.

The composition interpretation of the \xmax measurements
is only possible because this observable is well described
by Monte Carlo simulations using hadronic interaction models.
From~\cref{}, we can first see that the measured \xmaxmean lies
always in between the predictions for the lightest and the heaviest
primaries expected. Furthermore, it is important the fact that
the Monte Carlo predictions with different hadronic interaction models
do not diverge substantially, which reduces the model depencencies
on the composition interpretations of the measurements.

\subsection{Muon content and the muon deficit problem}
\label{sec:shower:observables:nmu}

Measurements of the number (or density) of muons at ground can
be done with several different types of surface detector arrays.
However, the muon measurements are strongly affected by specific features
of each experimental setup and, therefore, it is not possible in general
to compare the \nmu measured by different experiments. The experimental features
which affect the most the muon measurements are the muon energy threshold,
the lateral distance interval in which the muons are detected and the observation
level. 

To be able to detect muons isolately, the detectors are usually shielded so the
electromagnetic component can be absorbed before reaching being detected. This can
be done either by placing a layer of a heavy material on the top of the detector
or by buring it few meters below the ground level. It turns out that low energetic muons
also end up being shielded, which means that each experiment measures
muons above a different energy threshold and consequently the measured \nmu
is also different. The lateral distance range in which the muons are detected is also
an specific feature of each experiment that affects strongly the \nmu. Since
the experiments are always made of granular arrays, the distance between the detectors
usually determine in which lateral distance the \nmu is estimated. Lastly,
the observation level of the experiment affects the \nmu because of the atmospheric attenuation,
which affects much strongly the electromagnetic component, but it is still relevant for
muon detections.

Among the results of measurements of \nmu in air shower experiments,
we have selected three to present here. The first one are the
measurements by HiRes/MIA experiments of the density of muons at the ground
of air showers initiated by cosmic rays of energy approaximately in the range
between \E{17} and \E{18}. The experimental setup consisted of a set of fluorescence
telescopes of the HiRes experiment~\cite{\HiResPaper} combined with a detector array of
MIA~\cite{\MIAPaper}. The surface detectors were formed by scintilator counters
buried about 3 m below the ground level, which implies in an energy threshold for muons
of aroud 850 \MeV. As an estimator of the muon content, the density of muons at a lateral
distance of 600 m could be determined ($\rho_\mu(600)$).
In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu} we reproduce
the plot of $\rho_\mu(600)$ as a function of the primary energy as published
in Ref.~\cite{\HiResMIAMuonPaper}.
By comparing the measured muon density with predictions from Monte Carlo simulations,
it was found that the measured $\rho_\mu(600)$ was larger than the predictions for
the heaviest primaries expected, iron nuclei. This result was clearly inconsistent
in terms of composition and the conclusion that could be taken is that
the Monte Carlo simulations are deficient in muon production.
This was the first manifestation of what is usually called \emph{muon deficit problem}.

\end{figure}

The second muon content measurement to be presented was performed
by IceTop detector~\cite{\IceTopPaper}, part of the IceCube experiment~\cite{\IceCubePaper},
by using ice-Cherenkov tanks as surface detectors.
The primary energy range of these measurements goes from \E{15} to \E{17}
and the density of muons at 600 and 800 m from the shower axis was estimated
as muon content observable. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu}
we reproduce the plot from the Ref.~\cite{\IceTopMuonPaper}
which shows the $\rho_\mu$ as a function of energy compared to simulation predictions.
The muon deficit can be again seen at energies around \E{17}. Althought these are still
preliminary results, it is worthwhile to present it here because it shows that
the muon deficit problem is existing at relatively low energies (<\E{18}).


The third and final measurement of muon content presented here is
the one performed by Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerPaper}.
Even that its standard surface array
does not contain muon detectors, the number of muons can be measured by Auger
in highly inclined showers ($\theta > 60^\circ$). For this type of showers
the electromagnetic component is almost totally attenuated by the atmosphere
and the signal at the water-Cherenkov tanks is dominated by muons.
Unlike the previous measurements, the lateral distance of the detectors selected
to reconstruct the muon content is high, above YYY m. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu} we show the
average number of muons as measured by Auger compared
to simulations as published in Ref.\cite{\AugerHASMuonPaper}.
The primary energy range here is above \E{18.6} and the muon deficit is clear
at the whole energy range. It is important to point out that both models
which are shown for comparison are recent version updated with LHC results.
In Ref.~\cite{\AugerTopDownPaper} another Pierre Auger result
that confirms the muon deficit at energies
around \E{19}, but not using inclined showers, can be found.

In summary, the muon deficit problem is known for almost two decades
and at the moment it prevents us to do composition studies based on the
measurements of the muonic component of air showers. BlaBla
