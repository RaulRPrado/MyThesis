\chapter[Extensive air showers and UHECR composition]{Extensive air showers}
\label{sec:showers}

In this chapter, a brief introduction to Extensive Air Showers (EAS)
will be given. Althought the physics behind EAS is very rich,
in this text we will give more focus on the selected topics
which are intrinsically related to the main topic of this thesis.
More detailed and extended materials about EAS can be found
in Refs.~\cite{GaisserBook,GriederBook}.

\section{Extensive air shower phenomenology}
\label{sec:showers:phen}

An EAS start with the collision of the primary cosmic ray particle
with an atmospheric nucleus. After this first interaction, the secondary
particle produced also interact with the atmosphere producing more
particles and so on. This succession of interactions with particle production
create the cascade of particles that forms the air shower.
For the sake of clarity, the description of the cascade is tradionally
done by spliting it into different components: the \emph{electromagnetic},
the \emph{hadronic} and, eventually, the \emph{muonic component}. It is also traditional
to describe the EAS development in terms of its longitudinal and lateral profiles.
The former refers to the shower development along the direction of its axis
while the latter refers to the distribution of particles
along a perpendicular direction to shower axis.


The first interaction can produce tens or hundreds of
secondary particles, which are nearly all hadrons
with only an insignificant contribution of photons and leptons.
Among the produced hadrons, the dominant contribution is by far from pions ($>60\%$),
followed by kaons and nucleons at similar proportions ($\sim 10\%$). Other
types of mesons and baryons together count tipically for less than 5\% of
the particles~\cite{Calcagni:2017tws}.
Besides that, a very small fraction of nuclei can be produced
by the fragmentation of the target nucleus or the primary.
After the first interaction, the following air shower development is mostly driven
by the subsequent processes involving the pions. The three types of pions ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$ and $\pi^0$)
are produced at similar proportions, which means that about 2/3 of them are charged and
1/3 is neutral. The charged ones will be responsible to create more
hadrons and eventually muon and the neutral ones to create photons and
to fed the electromagnetic component of the shower.
First we will focus on the latter case.

%%================================%%
\subsection[Electromagnetic component and the \xmax]{\boldmath Electromagnetic component and the \xmax}
\label{sec:showers:phen:em}


Neutral pions can decay via the electromagnetic interaction into two photons ($\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma$)
with a very short decay length ($c\tau_0=25$ nm). Since in the atmosphere this decay length
is much shorter than the interaction one, nearly all the neutral pions end up decaying into
photons. The high energy photons produced interact electromagnetically, being the dominant
process the pair production ($\gamma\rightarrow e^++e^-$). The electrons and positrons
produced, in turn, also interact electromagnetically, mainly through bremstralung, which
produces more photons. The succession of these electromagnetic interactions
will create a self-sustainable cascade of photons, electrons and positrons
which forms the electromagnetic component of the extensive air shower.
Since more neutral pions are produced in hadronic interactions of secondary
particles with atmospheric nuclei (again in the 1/3 proportion wrt the charged pions),
the same chain of electromagnetic interactions will take place again
and new lower energy electromagnetic cascades are produced.
This means that the energy carried by the hadronic particles
is partially, but constinuously, trasfered to the electromagnetic particles.
After a few generations of hadronic interactions ($\sim 6$), about 90\% of
the primary energy is carried by the electromagnetic component.


The lenght scale of the bremstralung interaction, responsible to produce photons out of
electrons, is given by the radiation lenght, $X_0$, that is the average distance needed
to electrons to lose all but $1/e$ of its energy. In the atmosphere $X_0\approx 37\text{g/cm}^2$.
On the other hand, the lenght scale of pair production is of the same order
of $X_0$, only slightly larger ($\approx 1.3 X_0$). Because of the short lenght scale
given by $X_0$, the electromagnetic shower develops very rapidly, which
implies a fast increase of the number of particles and a fast decrease of their
average energy. As lower the particle energies, more relevant the energy losses
due to ionization become. The critical energy in which the ionization losses
becomes equivalent to the bremstralung ones is $E_c = 85 \MeV$ in the
atmosphere. After the average energy of electrons becomes close to $E_c$,
the number of particles starts to decrease, which creates the peaked shape
of the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic component.

In~\cref{} we show the average longitudinal profile of the number
of electrons ($N_e$) in air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei.
It is also shown for comparison the longitudinal profile of the
deposited energy (\dEdX) in the atmosphere by all the charged particles.
Because the number of particles in the shower is totally dominated
by the electromagnetic component, one can see that the shape of the
$N_e$ and \dEdX profiles are basically the same.
The depth correspondent to the maximum of both profiles is called
the shower maximum and it is symbolized by \xmax. In air shower
experiments, the \dEdX profile can be accessed by telescopes which
measure the fluorescence light emitted by the interaction of the air shower
with the atmosphere. The \xmax of the shower can then be easily determined
from the \dEdX profile.

The dependences of \xmax with the primary energy and with the type
of the primary particle can be expressed by the relation
\begin{equation}
  \langle\xmax\rangle = \lambda_\text{I}(A)+D_{10}\;\log_{10}\frac{E_0}{A},
  \label{eq:shower:xmax}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\text{I}$ is the mean free path of the first interaction,
$E_0$ is the energy of the primary particle and $A$ is its nuclear mass.
The quantity $D_{10} = \frac{ \text{d} \xmaxmean }{ \text{d} \log_{10}E_0 }$
is called \emph{elongation rate} and it does not depend on $E_0$ and $A$.
Although the~\cref{eq:shower:xmax} can be derived by simplistic analtytic models~\cite{Matthews:2005sd},
it can also be certified by using full Monte Carlo simulations.

In~\cref{} we show the \xmaxmean as a function of the primary energy
for a set of simulatied air showers. The logaritmic energy dependece is clear,
as well as the separation between proton and iron initiated showers.
This dependence of \xmaxmean with the primary mass comes from both terms
on the right side of~\cref{eq:shower:xmax}, since $\lambda_\text{I}$
decreases with increasing $A$. The difference between \xmaxmean for
proton and iron initiated showers is $\sim 100 \text{g/cm}^2$, as can
be seen in~\cref{}. It is also clear from~\cref{} that the elongation rate
$D_{10}$ is nearly constant with energy and does not depend on the primary type.
For using \xmax measurements to infer the primary composition of
cosmic rays, both the differences on \xmax for different primaries and
the constancy of $D_{10}$ are important features. More about measurements
of \xmax will be given in~\cref{}. 


%%================================%%
\subsection{Hadronic component and muon production}
\label{sec:showers:phen:had}

Unlike the neutral pions, the charged ones can only decay weakly,
with a much longer decay length ($c\tau_0=7.8$ m)
than the electromagnetic $\pi^0$ decay.  
At high energies, however, their interaction length
is much smaller than the decay one. This means that most
of the charged pions actually interact with atmospheric nuclei
producing more particles at similar proportions as the ones produced
in the first interaction. While the neutral pions produced
fed the electromagnetic shower, as explained above, the charged ones
can keep interacting and producing more hadrons. The hadrons
produced by this chain of hadronic interactions compose the
hadronic component of the shower.

As lower the energy of the charged pions, larger the probability
that it decays instead of interacting again. The dominant decay channel
for charged pions is into muons and neutrinos ($\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$)
and the critical energy in which the probability of decaying is
equivalent to interacting is 85 \GeV. These decays are responsible
to produce the great majority of the muons of an air shower.
The tipical number of interactions of charged pions before
decaying into muons is 4--8. 


Apart from pion decays, a considerably fraction of the muons reaching
the ground is produced by the decay of charged kaons. In~\cite{} the muon
production in air showers was studyied in details and it was found
by using simulations that $\sim 90\%$ of the muons come from the decay
of charged pions and $\sim 10\%$ of charged kaons. While these particles
are called \emph{mother}, the particles which interacted hadronically
with an atmospheric nucleus to produce them is are called \emph{grandmother}.
Concerning then the properties of the grandmother particles,
it was found that more than 70\% of them are pions, $\approx 20\%$ are nucleons
and $\approx 6\%$ are kaons. In~\cref{fig:shower:phen:ioana} the energy distributions of the
grandmother particles are shown and we can see the contribution from these
different types of particles~\cite{\IoanaICRC}. The dominance of pions as gradmother is clear,
as well as the fact that most of the interactions of the grandmother particles
occur at energies of order of $\sim 100 \GeV$.

  \end{overpic}
  
  \caption{\cite{\IoanaICRC}}
  \label{fig:shower:phen:ioana}
\end{figure}


Although the interaction of the grandmother particle is very important,
it has to be noted that the whole chain of hadronic interactions, which are
mostly pion-air interactions, influence the muon production. This means
that any shower observable related to the muonic component is sensitive to the
properties of hadronic interactions which occur along the shower. The particle
production in these hadronic interactions is particularly important and,
in the context of this thesis, it is worthwhile to point out the effect of
(anti)baryon production. Most of the (anti)baryons produced are
nucleons (\proton, \antiproton, \neutron and \antineutron) and they
are all produced in similar proportions. Since these particles
can only interact again, their energy is surely use to fed the
hadronic component, which means that this energy is partially converted
in muons production. Because of that, the increase of (anti)baryon
production in hadron-air interactions has been considered a very important
mechanism to increase the final number of muons in the shower~\cite{\EposPaper,Drescher:2007hc}.
\note{spectrum of muons}


In~\cref{} we show the average longitudinal profile of
the number of muons, as well as the muon production,
for proton and iron initiated showers. The number of muons (\nmu) observed
at a given atmospheric depth is a tipical quantity of the shower.
From simplistic analytic models and full Monte Carlo simulations,
we can see that \nmu relates to the primary energy and mass as
\begin{equation}
  \nmumean \approx A^{1-\beta} E_0^\beta,
  \label{eq:shower:nmu}
\end{equation}
where $\beta\approx 0.9$. The energy and primary mass dependence
of \nmumean can be seen in~\cref{}, where we show the \nmumean
as a function of $\log_{10}E_0$, also for proton and iron
initiated showers.
Results of recent measurements of \nmu, as well as other
observables related to the muonic component will be presented
in~\cref{sec:shower:observables}.

\section{Air shower simulations}
\label{sec:shower:simulations}

In this section we give a short overview of the air shower simulations,
including a description of the most used simulation codes, in~\cref{sec:shower:simulations:codes}, and
an overview of the hadronic interaction models used by them, in~\cref{sec:shower:simulations:models}. 
Besides the hadronic interaction models, the air shower simulation codes also
make use of electromagnetic interaction models. The commonly used one is EGYYY.
Since the electromagnetic proccesses are properly described by QED theory,
their modelling is not a source of uncertainties on the air shower simulations.
Because of that, we will only focus here on the hadronic interaction models,
which, in turn, are the most relevant source of uncertainty.
More detailed approaches to the topic can be found
in Refs.~\cite{Knapp:2002vs,Engel:2011zzb,Allen:2013ofa}.


%%================================%%
\subsection{Simulation strategy and codes}
\label{sec:shower:simulations:codes}


To simulate an air shower taking into account all the
relevant aspects is surely a very complex task.
All the particles produced have to be propagated 3-dimensionally
thought the atmosphere and their interactions with atmospheric atoms
have to be properly modelled. The effect of the
structure of the atmosphere with changing density
and the earth magnetic field have to be taken into account.
Besides that, the extremely large number of particles makes
the computational cost of a shower simulation also very large.
Therefeore, the full simulation of air showers turns to be
impossible for pratical purposes and, thus, spetial strategies
have to be applied by simulation softwares to reduce the complexity
of the problem.


The most complete softwares apply Monte Carlo methods to simulate
the 3-dimensional propagation of the particles and their interactions
along the whole shower development.
This class of software includes \Mooca~\cite{\MoocaPaper},
\Aires~\cite{\AiresPaper} and \Corsika~\cite{\CorsikaPaper},
being the latter the one used in this thesis.
To reduce the computing time, an algorithm called \emph{thinning}
is usually applied~\cite{}. Intead of following all the particles
produced, the thinning algorithm selects only a
number of them to follow and give to these particles
a weight that corresponds to the number of particles which
are not being followed anymore.


A few parameters is usually needed
to set up the thinning configuration. As an example, in \Corsika
the maximum particle energy in which the thinning algorithm is applied is
set by the YYY parameter, which is actually the fraction of the maximum energy
with relation to the energy of the primary. The can be set separetely for
electromagnetic and hadronic particles and tipical values are between $10^{-2}--10^{-7}$.
As smaller the values of YYY, more precise the simulation will be, but with the cost
of longer computing time. The maximum weight allowed is also a parameter to be set
and its tipical values lie between 100-10000~\cite{}. Since the thinning algorithm removes
the important information of the geometrical spread of the particles, for some analysis
an \emph{un-thinning} algorithm has to be applied~\cite{Stokes:2011wf}.

A second class of simulation codes makes use of Monte Carlo techniques
to simulate only the highest energies interactions and, below a certain
energy threshold, cascade equation are applied~\cite{Bossard:2000jh} to compute the
number of each type of particle as a function of the amospheric depth.
This means that the solution of the cascade equation gives only a 1-dimensional
description of the shower and all the information about the lateral distributions of
the particles is lost. Since for many applications only the longitudinal profile
of the shower is needed, this class of software turns to be very usefull.
The very short computing time required to solve the cascade equations
makes these softwares very fast. One of the most used code of this kind
is \Conex~\cite{\ConexPaper},
which is used in this thesis. The \Seneca code~\cite{\SenecaPaper}  
also makes use of cascade equations but includes a re-sampling
algorithm to recover the lateral particle distributions in the final stages
of the shower. It is worthwhile mentioning that the current
version of the \Corsika code can also simulate showers in the hybrid mode,
similar to \Conex or \Seneca.



%%================================%%
\subsection{Hadronic interaction models}
\label{sec:shower:simulations:models}


The models used to describe the hadronic interactions at high energies 
are by far the most relevant source of uncertainties on the prediction of
air shower observables by simulations. Although the strong interactions can be
sucesfully described by the \emph{quantum cromodynamics} theory (QCD),
we are still not able to compute the bulk of hadronic particle production processes. 

The hadronic interactions are described by first considering hadrons as constituted
by point-like particles called \emph{partons}. Then, the interactions between partons
are treated diferently depending on the transfer momentum: \emph{hard} and \emph{soft}
proccesses, in which there is a large and small momentum transfer, respectively.
While the properties of hard proccesses can be properly computed by means of
perturbative QCD, the soft ones require either lattice calculations~\cite{}
or phenomenological models to be described. Because of the long processing time
required by lattice calculations, the phenomenological approach
is usually applied by hadronic interaction models.

All the currently used hadronic models for high-energy interactions
are based on Gribov's Reggeon Field Theory~\cite{Gribov1968,Drescher:2000ha}, in which
parton-parton scattering is described by the exchaging of particles
called \emph{reggeons} and \emph{pomerons}. Another examples of commom features
of all models are the applicattion of minijet and string fragmentations models.
An intrinsic feature of these phenomenological models is the large number of parameters
that cannot be determined only by the theory, but they have to be tunned instead.
For that, a large number of accelerator measurements are used. The problem with this
strategy is that the accelerator measurements cover only a small fraction
of the energy range and particle production phase space that is relevant
for describing air showers. 

In particular, three problems can be mentioned.
First, the highest energies collisions studied in accelerators
($\sqrt{s} = 13 \TeV$ reached by LHC) is still much lower
energetic than the interaction of a high energy cosmic ray ($\sqrt{s}\approx 400$ for
a \E{20} primary proton). Second, there is a lack of measurements
of particle production at the forward region, which is the most relevant
to understand particle production in soft interaction and also
the most relevant for the air shower development. Finally,
there is a lack of accelerator data concerning some colliding systems
that are very important for air shower physics,
e.g. pion-air and kaon-air interactions.

As a consequence of the phenomenological nature of the models
in combination with the problems with accelerator data listed above,
the predictions of air shower simulations with different hadronic
interaction models turn to be dissonant(?). Because of that,
the commom approach is to compare the air shower measurements to
simulations with a number of different models and to treat
the differences between them as a theoretical uncertainty. 

For air shower studies, the most currently used models
for high energy interactions are
\QGSJetLong~\cite{\QGSJetPaper}, \EposLong~\cite{\EposPaper},
\EposLHCLong~\cite{\EposLHCPaper}, \SibyllLong~\cite{\SibyllPaper},
\SibyllNewLong~\cite{\NewSibyllPaper} and \DPMJetLong~\cite{\DPMJetPaper}.
Among these, only \QGSJetLong, \EposLHCLong and \SibyllNewLong are updated
to take into account recent LHC data. 

Below a certain energy threshold ($\sim 100 \GeV$), the hadronic interactions
in air shower simulations are described by the low energy models, which
are much simpler than the high energy ones. The particle production, for example,
is usually modelled by means of parametrizations.
The most used low energy models are \Urqmd~\cite{\UrqmdPaper},
\Gheisha~\cite{Gheisha1985} and \Fluka~\cite{\FlukaPaper}.
A review of these models can be found in Ref.\cite{Heck:2004rq}.

The influence of the low energy models on the number of muons in air
showers have been shown in Ref.\cite{Maris:2009uc}. In this thesis, we show in~\cref{sec:observable}
that they are also relevant for the spectrum of the muons at the ground.

\section{Measurements of air shower observables}
\label{sec:shower:observables}

In this section, a compilation of recent measurements of EAS observables
will be presented. We start in~\cref{sec:shower:observables:xmax}
by the \xmax measurements which are the most reliable
observable to be used to infer composition of cosmic rays. 
In~\cref{sec:shower:observables:nmu,sec:shower:observables:xmumax}
we focus on two muonic observables, the \nmu and \xmumax,
which currently cannot be direct used for composition studies
due to the inconsistency between the measurements and the predictions
from Monte Carlo simulations. In~\cref{sec:shower:observables:further}
we briefly mention further observables which have been measured recently.


%%================================%%
\subsection{Shower maximum and cosmic ray composition}
\label{sec:shower:observables:xmax}

The \xmax (see~\cref{sec:showers:phen:em}) can be measured directly
by fluorescence telescopes, which can measure the energy deposited
by the air shower along the atmosphere. This technique was first sucesfully applied
by Fly's Eyes experiment~\cite{\FlysEyesPaper},
posteriorly followed by HiRes~\cite{\HiResPaper} and recently it
has been used by Telescope Array~\cite{\TAXmaxPaper} and
Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerPaper,\AugerXmaxPRDPaper}.
Another technique commonly used in the past to measure tha \xmax
are the non-imaging Cherenkov detectors. From the lateral profile
of the Cherenkov light measured in surface detectors, it is possible
to infer the longitudinal position of the shower maximum~\cite{}.
This method was used by Tunka~\cite{\TunkaPaper,\TunkaXmaxPaper},
Yakutsk~\cite{\YakutskPaper,\YakutskXmaxPaper} and CASA-BLANCA~\cite{\CasaBlancaXmaxPaper}.
In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:all}
we show a compilation of \xmaxmean measurements from \E{15.0}
up to the highest energies and
in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:uhe} we show the most up to date
\xmax results of Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerXmaxICRC2017Paper}
and Telescope Array~\cite{TAComp2017}.
The standard deviation of the \xmax distribution, $\sigma[\xmax]$,
is also shown altogheter with the \xmaxmean.

The colored lines in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:all}
show the \xmaxmean predictions from
Monte Carlo simulations. It is traditional to show lines for
the lightest primary expected, protons, and for the heaviest, iron nuclei.
By comparing the \xmax measurements with the Monte Carlo predictions,
one can obtain information about the average composition of the primary cosmic rays.
Besides the comparison of the \xmax moments (\xmaxmean and $\sigma[\xmax]$),
the full \xmax distributions can be compared and the fractions of different
groups of primaries can be fitted. This procedure has only been applied by Pierre Auger
Observatory~\cite{Aab:2014aea}.

The composition interpretation of the \xmax measurements
is only possible because this observable is well described
by Monte Carlo simulations using hadronic interaction models.
From~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:all},
we can first see that the measured \xmaxmean lies
always in between the predictions for the lightest and the heaviest
primaries expected. Furthermore, it is important the fact that
the Monte Carlo predictions with different hadronic interaction models
do not diverge substantially, which reduces the model depencencies
on the composition interpretations of the measurements.

Another importante feature of the \xmax analyses is
that the detector biases can be fully removed and the measured values
of the \xmaxmean and $\sigma[\xmax]$ can be directly compared to
the ones from shower simulations, without the requirement of simulating
the detection proccess. The Pierre Auger Observatory remove most of the
detector biases by using the so called \emph{fiducial volume cuts},
which reduces significantly the number of events~\cite{}.
On the other hand, because of the lack of statistics,
Telescope Array opt for to not perform any strategy to unbias the measurements.
Intead, the measured \xmaxmean and $\sigma[\xmax]$ are compared to
simulation that include all the detector effects. As a consequence,
the \xmaxmean and $\sigma[\xmax]$ as measured by both experiments cannot
be compared to each other directly.

From~\cref{fig:shower:observables:xmax:uhe}, the composition interpretation
of both Auger and Telescope Array \xmax measurements seem to be incompatible.
The Auger data shows a clear changing of the average composition from a very light
composition around \E{18.3} to an intermediate one around \E{19.5}. This trending is confirmed
by the fits of \xmax distributions shown in Ref.\cite{Aab:2014aea}.
The Telescope Array data, on the other hand, shows a constant composition
which is dominantly light, between proton and helium nuclei, from \E{18.2}
up to the highest energies. This apparent inconsistency has been studied
by a working group formed of members of both collaboration and the most recent
conclusion is that, taking into account the detector effects intrinsic of the Telescope Array
mesurements and all the systematic uncertainties, the results from both experiments
are consistency up to \E{19.0}~\cite{VitorICRC2017}.
Above this energy is not possible to take any conclusion
because of the lack of statistics of the Telescope Array measurements. 



%%================================%%
\subsection{Muon content and the muon deficit problem}
\label{sec:shower:observables:nmu}

Measurements of the number (or density) of muons at ground can
be done with several different types of surface detector arrays.
However, the muon measurements are strongly affected by specific features
of each experimental setup and, therefore, it is not possible in general
to compare the \nmu measured by different experiments. The experimental features
which affect the most the muon measurements are the muon energy threshold,
the lateral distance interval in which the muons are detected and the observation
level. 

To be able to detect muons isolately, the detectors are usually shielded so the
electromagnetic component can be absorbed before reaching being detected. This can
be done either by placing a layer of a heavy material on the top of the detector
or by buring it few meters below the ground level. It turns out that low energetic muons
also end up being shielded, which means that each experiment measures
muons above a different energy threshold and consequently the measured \nmu
is also different. The lateral distance range in which the muons are detected is also
an specific feature of each experiment that affects strongly the \nmu. Since
the experiments are always made of granular arrays, the distance between the detectors
usually determine in which lateral distance the \nmu is estimated. Lastly,
the observation level of the experiment affects the \nmu because of the atmospheric attenuation,
which affects much strongly the electromagnetic component, but it is still relevant for
muon detections.

Among the results of measurements of \nmu in air shower experiments,
we have selected three to present here. The first one are the
measurements by HiRes/MIA experiments of the density of muons at the ground
of air showers initiated by cosmic rays of energy approaximately in the range
between \E{17} and \E{18}. The experimental setup consisted of a set of fluorescence
telescopes of the HiRes experiment~\cite{\HiResPaper} combined with a detector array of
MIA~\cite{\MIAPaper}. The surface detectors were formed by scintilator counters
buried about 3 m below the ground level, which implies in an energy threshold for muons
of aroud 850 \MeV. As an estimator of the muon content, the density of muons at a lateral
distance of 600 m could be determined ($\rho_\mu(600)$).
In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu} we reproduce
the plot of $\rho_\mu(600)$ as a function of the primary energy as published
in Ref.~\cite{\HiResMIAMuonPaper}.
By comparing the measured muon density with predictions from Monte Carlo simulations,
it was found that the measured $\rho_\mu(600)$ was larger than the predictions for
the heaviest primaries expected, iron nuclei. This result was clearly inconsistent
in terms of composition and the conclusion that could be taken is that
the Monte Carlo simulations are deficient in muon production.
This was the first manifestation of what is usually called \emph{muon deficit problem}.

The second muon content measurement to be presented was performed
by IceTop detector~\cite{\IceTopPaper}, part of the IceCube experiment~\cite{\IceCubePaper},
by using ice-Cherenkov tanks as surface detectors.
The primary energy range of these measurements goes from \E{15} to \E{17}
and the density of muons at 600 and 800 m from the shower axis was estimated
as muon content observable. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu}
we reproduce the plot from the Ref.~\cite{\IceTopMuonPaper}
which shows the $\rho_\mu$ as a function of energy compared to simulation predictions.
The muon deficit can be again seen at energies around \E{17}. Althought these are still
preliminary results, it is worthwhile to present it here because it shows that
the muon deficit problem is existing at relatively low energies (<\E{18}).


The third and final measurement of muon content presented here is
the one performed by Pierre Auger Observatory~\cite{\AugerPaper}.
Even that its standard surface array
does not contain muon detectors, the number of muons can be measured by Auger
in highly inclined showers ($\theta > 60^\circ$). For this type of showers
the electromagnetic component is almost totally attenuated by the atmosphere
and the signal at the water-Cherenkov tanks is dominated by muons.
Unlike the previous measurements, the lateral distance of the detectors selected
to reconstruct the muon content is high, above YYY m. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:nmu} we show the
average number of muons as measured by Auger compared
to simulations as published in Ref.\cite{\AugerHASMuonPaper}.
The primary energy range here is above \E{18.6} and the muon deficit is clear
at the whole energy range. It is important to point out that both models
which are shown for comparison are recent version updated with LHC results.
In Ref.~\cite{\AugerTopDownPaper} another Pierre Auger result
that confirms the muon deficit at energies
around \E{19}, but not using inclined showers, can be found.

In conclusion, the muon deficit problem is known for almost two decades
and at the moment it prevents us to do composition studies based on the
measurements of the muonic component of air showers. In~\cref{sec:interpretation}
we present a method to interpret the energy evolution of the moments
of the number of muons measurements in terms of cosmic rays
composition, taking into account the muon deficit problem.

\subsection{Further measurements}
\label{sec:shower:observables:further}

In this section we briefly mention four further
measurements of air shower observables, the first one
made by KASCADE-Grande experiment~\cite{\KASCADEGrandePaper}
and the remaining three by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

The KASCADE-Grande experiment can measure both
number of charged particles and number of muons
in air showers with primary energy between
YYY and YYY. In a recent analysis, the
KASCADE-Grande collaboration has studied the evolution
of the \nmu with the zenith angle of the shower by using
a parameter called muon attenuation length ($\Lambda_\mu$). 
Since the atmospheric attenuation of the muonic component
depends on the energy of muons, the parameter $\Lambda_\mu$ turns to
be sensitive to muon energy spectra. Thus, by comparing the measurements
to Monte Carlo predictions it is possible to test muon production
properties of the hadronic interaction models. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:further}
we reproduce the plot from Ref.~\cite{Apel:2017thr} that compares the measured value of 
$\Lambda_\mu$ with simulations and what can be seen is that none of
the currently used models can describe properly the muon attenuation.
The primary energy range of this analysis is similar to the one of IceTop shown
in the previous section.


The second measurement to be presented is the longitudinal depth
of the maximum of the muon production profile (\xmumax),
which can be measured by using the temporal structure of the
water-Cherenkov detectors of Pierre Auger Observatory
in highly inclined showers~\cite{\AugerMPDPaper}.
The main results is the energy evolution of \xmumaxmean that is show
in~\cref{fig:shower:observables:further}.
Althought the composition interpretation of these measurements
depends strongly on the hadronic interaction model, it can be seen that
for both \QGSJetLong and \EposLHCLong the infered composition would be
much heavier than the expected from the \xmaxmean measurements. The \EposLHCLong
case is worst because it implies a composition even heavier than iron nuclei.
In Refs.~\cite{Ostapchenko:2016bir,Pierog:2015ifw}
it has been shown that \xmumax is very sensitive to the properties of
the pion-air interactions and therefore it can be effectively used to contrain
hadronic models.


The third and forth observables to be mentioned are related to the quantity called
rise-time, which is defined as the time difference between the water-Cherenkov detectors
reach 10 and 50\% of their total signal. This quantity is related to both the
electromagnetic and muonic component of the shower.
In Ref.~\cite{\AugerAsymmetryPaper} an analysis of the azimutal asymmetry of the rise-time
was published where a parameter called \emph{rise-time asymmetry} was defined.
A second analysis was published in Ref.\cite{\AugerDeltaPaper} applied the so called
\emph{delta method} that uses the rise-time dependence on the lateral distance to define
a parameter called delta. In~\cref{fig:shower:observables:further} and 
we show the main results of both analysis.
The conclusions of from both analysis are similar, being that the composition
extraced directly from rt and delta are not fully compatible with the one
expected from \xmax measurements. However, the inconsistency is not
as strong as in the case of \nmu and \xmumax. This intermediate behavior can
be understood by the fact that the rise-time parameter is not sensitive to
only one shower component, but instead, to both electromagnetic and muonic ones.
